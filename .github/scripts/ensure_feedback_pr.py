"""classroom50 Feedback PR maintainer.

Fetched from the teacher's GitHub Pages site by the autograde-runner
reusable workflow's "Ensure Feedback PR" step, the same way runner.py is
fetched and run. Lives here (not inline in the workflow) so the ~160 lines
of control flow are unit-testable with a stubbed `gh`; the workflow step is
a thin curl+exec shim.

Opt-in per assignment (the workflow only invokes this when feedback-pr is
on and there's a diff to show). Maintains ONE long-lived PR per repo:
  base = the frozen `feedback` branch at the baseline commit
  head = the repo's default branch
so the teacher reviews the full starter->latest diff with inline comments,
and it auto-updates on every submission. PRs opened by GITHUB_TOKEN don't
retrigger workflows, so there's no loop.

Behavior (ported verbatim from the former inline bash):
  1. Freeze the base: create the `feedback` branch at BASE_SHA once, never
     advance it. If it already exists at a DIFFERENT sha, a student may have
     pre-created it (ruleset leaves creation open) -> refuse to open/refresh
     the PR against an unverified base, post a failure status, and stop.
  2. Find the single PR (any state). If none, create it (labeled by mode);
     on a create race lost to a concurrent run, re-query and treat the
     existing PR as success. If one exists, reopen only a student's
     *unmerged* close (a teacher merge is the grading-done signal).
  3. Always post a machine-readable `classroom50/feedback-pr` commit status
     (success | failure | error), mirroring `classroom50/autograde`. The
     status defaults to `error` and is promoted to `success` only at the
     verified-good end, so an early failure reports error, not false success.

Environment (set by the autograde-runner workflow's grade job):
  GH_TOKEN            token for `gh` (Actions GITHUB_TOKEN)
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY   <owner>/<repo>
  GITHUB_SHA          graded commit SHA (the status target)
  GITHUB_SERVER_URL   https://github.com (or GHES base)
  GITHUB_RUN_ID       for the fallback status target_url
  BASE_SHA            the trusted baseline commit to freeze the base at
  MODE                assignment mode (individual | group), for the PR label

Exits 0 for every outcome (like runner.py): the status carries success vs
failure vs error. Exits non-zero only on missing required env (invoked
outside the workflow).
