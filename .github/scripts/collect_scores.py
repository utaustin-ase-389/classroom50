"""Teacher-triggered scores collector.

Walks roster × assignment manifest: for each (student, assignment)
pair, pages through the canonical `<classroom>-<assignment>-<username>`
repo's `submit/*` releases, validates each `result.json` asset, and
upserts into `<classroom>/scores.json`.

`scores.json` is keyed by assignment slug under the root `assignments`
object: each value is `{ "type": "individual"|"group", "entries": [...] }`.
An `entry` is one student repo's gradebook record (one per repo owner):
identity/keying at the top level (`owner`; plus `member_usernames` for a
group entry — the credited roster collaborators) and the full
per-submission history inside a `submissions` list (newest first). Each
`submissions` item is a validated `result.json` payload (minus the
redundant `assignment` bucket key; it carries `owner` + `assignment_type`
+ optional `submitted_by`, no `usernames`), so every push to `main` that
produced a `submit/*` release is retained — not just the latest. When the
assignment has a `due` date in assignments.json, each submission record
carries `"late": true|false` (its `datetime` vs. `due`). Advisory only —
nothing enforces the deadline; late submissions are still collected and
scored.

Single writer per scores.json. Re-runs are idempotent: unchanged
submissions are no-ops, and `"override": true` entries are
preserved verbatim so teacher corrections never get overwritten.

Per-classroom writes are atomic via tmp + os.replace. A missing
release is not an error (student hasn't accepted/submitted yet);
the per-assignment "X of Y submitted" log shows roster coverage.

Environment (set by `collect-scores.yaml`):
  CLASSROOM50_SERVICE_TOKEN — fine-grained PAT, Contents: Read and write.
                              Collection only reads; the write scope is
                              shared with regrade.yaml (pushes submit/* tags).
  CLASSROOM_FILTER          — optional single-classroom limit.
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER   — org name (auto-set by Actions).
  GITHUB_API_URL            — API URL on GHES runners.
  GH_API_URL                — explicit override (test servers).

Exit codes:
  0 — success.
  1 — operational failure (missing token, malformed scores.json,
      unrecoverable network error). The run log points the teacher
      at `gh teacher rotate-service-token` for PAT issues.
