"""Teacher-triggered scores collector.

Walks the classroom teams × assignment manifest: for each (team member,
assignment) pair, pages the canonical `<classroom>-<assignment>-<username>`
repo's `submit/*` releases, validates each `result.json` asset, and upserts
into `<classroom>/scores.json`. The polled members are the union of the
classroom's STUDENT team and its STAFF teams (teacher/hta/ta), so a staff
member who accepted an assignment to test the autograde flow is collected like
a student. Staff who never accepted have no assignment repo, so their poll
returns no releases and they produce no entry (the "accepted" gate is implicit
in the per-repo release read). The classroom GitHub teams are the source of
truth for enrollment; the roster (roster.csv) is only a
best-effort source of optional display metadata (name/section/email).

`scores.json` is keyed by assignment slug under root `assignments`: each value
is `{ "type": "individual"|"group", "entries": [...] }`. An `entry` is one
student repo's record (one per repo owner): identity/keying at the top
(`owner`; plus `member_usernames` for group — the credited collaborators) and
the full per-submission history in `submissions` (newest first). Each
`submissions` item is a validated `result.json` payload minus the redundant
`assignment` bucket key (it carries `owner` + `assignment_type` + optional
`submitted_by`, no `usernames`). When the assignment has a `due` date, each
record carries `"late": true|false` (its `datetime` vs. `due`) — advisory only;
late submissions are still collected and scored.

Single writer per scores.json. Re-runs are idempotent: unchanged submissions
are no-ops, and `"override": true` entries are preserved verbatim so teacher
corrections aren't overwritten. Per-classroom writes are atomic (tmp +
os.replace). A missing release is not an error (student hasn't
accepted/submitted); the per-assignment "X of Y submitted" log shows coverage.

Environment (set by `collect-scores.yaml`):
  CLASSROOM50_SERVICE_TOKEN — fine-grained PAT. Needs Organization ->
                              Members: Read (collection lists the classroom
                              team), Repository -> Contents: Read and write
                              (read scope used here; write scope shared with
                              regrade.yaml), and Repository -> Administration:
                              Read and write (grant staff teams repo access via
                              PUT teams/.../repos/...).
  CLASSROOM_FILTER          — optional single-classroom limit.
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER   — org name (auto-set by Actions).
  GITHUB_API_URL            — API URL on GHES runners.
  GH_API_URL                — explicit override (test servers).

Exit codes:
  0 — success.
  1 — operational failure (missing token, malformed scores.json, unrecoverable
      network error). The run log points at `gh teacher rotate-service-token`
      for PAT issues.
