"""Teacher-triggered regrade fan-out.

Re-runs the autograder across an assignment's student repos WITHOUT changing
each student's submission. For every targeted repo it re-runs the repo's
latest `autograde.yaml` workflow run via the Actions rerun API: that grades
the SAME commit again and re-fetches the current autograder from Pages, so a
teacher's fixed test / updated autograder takes effect. Because the runner
stamps the submission `datetime` from the graded commit's committer date (not
the grade time), the student's submission time and `late` flag are unchanged —
only the score/`graded_at` move.

A re-run replays the run at ITS ORIGINAL submit/* commit, NOT the current
`main` HEAD: regrade refreshes the score for an EXISTING submission, it does
not grade newer un-submitted work a student may have pushed since. (Only the
first-grade fallback below tags the current `main` HEAD.)

A repo that has a `main` HEAD but no prior autograde run to re-run (never
graded) is first-graded by pushing a fresh `submit/<UTC-timestamp>-<short-sha>`
tag, which fires its autograde workflow. Repos with no `main` HEAD (student
hasn't accepted/pushed) are skipped.

After this script re-runs/tags, grading happens ASYNCHRONOUSLY inside each
student repo, so the refreshed releases are ingested by the next
`collect-scores.py` run (nightly or "Collect now"). Until that next collect,
the gradebook still shows the PRE-regrade scores — there is an
eventual-consistency window, by design (collecting here would race the
still-running grade jobs).

Roster-driven, mirroring `collect_scores.py`: the (student, assignment)
pairs come from `<classroom>/students.csv` x `<classroom>/assignments.json`.
A single `OWNER_FILTER` narrows the fan-out to one repo (the per-row
"Regrade" action in the web UI); empty means the whole assignment.

Environment (set by `regrade.yaml`):
  CLASSROOM50_SERVICE_TOKEN — fine-grained PAT, Contents: Read and write AND
                              Actions: Read and write on the student repos.
                              Actions: write re-runs a run; Contents: write
                              pushes a submit/* tag for the first-grade case.
  CLASSROOM_FILTER          — classroom short-name (required for regrade).
  ASSIGNMENT_FILTER         — assignment slug (required for regrade).
  OWNER_FILTER              — optional single repo-owner login; empty means
                              every rostered student for the assignment.
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER   — org name (auto-set by Actions).
  GITHUB_API_URL            — API URL on GHES runners.
  GH_API_URL                — explicit override (test servers).

Exit codes:
  0 — success (every targeted repo was re-run, first-graded, or had nothing
      to do).
  1 — operational failure (missing token/inputs, auth rejection,
      unrecoverable network error). Per-repo failures warn and skip.
