"""classroom50 runner.

Fetched from the teacher's GitHub Pages site by the autograde-runner
reusable workflow on every submission. Responsibilities:

  1. Read env (CLASSROOM, ASSIGNMENT, SUBMISSION_TAG, etc.)
  2. Compute helper values (USERNAME, COMMIT_URL, RELEASE_URL,
     REVIEW_URL)
  3. Download the per-assignment bundle from Pages, extract it
  4. Resolve the entrypoint:
       per-assignment <classroom>/autograders/<slug>/autograder.py
       (extracted from the bundle), or
       classroom default at <classroom>/autograder.py
       (fetched from the per-classroom Pages URL).
       When neither exists, synthesize a vacuous-pass result so the
       workflow still publishes the submit-tag release with a clear
       "no autograder configured" status.
  5. Exec the entrypoint with the helper env vars and cwd at the
     student's repo checkout
  6. Read the autograder's outputs: ./result.json,
     ./release-body.md, and status= / summary= entries in
     $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Synthesize anything the autograder didn't
     write so the workflow's downstream steps always have something
     v1-shaped to publish.

Teachers don't normally edit this file. Per-assignment grading
logic lives in autograder.py — see the Autograders wiki page.

The runner exits 0 for every grading outcome — including failures
(bundle fetch error, malformed result.json, autograder rc != 0, etc.),
which are reported via a synthetic error result + status=error so the
workflow's release/commit-status steps still fire and the gradebook
still ingests the submission. The one exception is missing required
env vars (PAGES_BASE_URL, CLASSROOM, ASSIGNMENT, SUBMISSION_TAG):
without those identity fields the runner can't synthesize a v1-shaped
result.json, so it fails fast with exit 1 — this only happens when
the script is invoked outside the autograde-runner workflow.

Environment (set by the autograde-runner workflow):
  PAGES_BASE_URL    org-level Pages URL of the classroom50 config repo
  CLASSROOM         classroom short-name
  ASSIGNMENT        assignment slug
  SUBMISSION_TAG    submit/<UTC-timestamp>-<short-sha>
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY <owner>/<repo>
  GITHUB_SHA        commit SHA
  GITHUB_SERVER_URL https://github.com (or GHES base)
  GITHUB_ACTOR      fallback username when the repo name doesn't
                    follow the <classroom>-<assignment>-<username>
                    convention
  GITHUB_OUTPUT     workflow-step output sink

Additional env vars passed through to the entrypoint:
  USERNAME          student GitHub username (derived from repo name)
  COMMIT_URL        link to the graded commit on github.com
  RELEASE_URL       link to the submission release on github.com
  REVIEW_URL        full diff (baseline...graded commit); equals
                    COMMIT_URL when history is unavailable or there
                    is nothing to compare (baseline == commit)
