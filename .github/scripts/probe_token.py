"""Teacher-triggered service-token probe.

Exercises EVERY GitHub API scope the CLASSROOM50_SERVICE_TOKEN needs, so a
teacher runs one workflow after provisioning/rotating and gets a single
green/red signal covering scopes the pre-provisioning validators (`gh teacher
init` / the web "validate & save") can't cheaply check — the org-team read and
the repo-level Actions permission that only surface at collect/regrade time.

SIDE-EFFECT FREE by design. Never pushes a tag, re-runs a workflow, writes a
secret, or mutates a repo. Write scopes are proven with read-only PROXIES that
GitHub gates behind the write permission:

  - Contents: write  -> GET /repos/{org}/classroom50 reports
                        `permissions.push == true` only with contents-write
                        (same signal the CLI/web validators use).
  - Administration: write -> the same GET reports `permissions.admin == true`
                        only with the Administration permission (collect grants
                        staff teams repo access via PUT teams/.../repos/...).
  - Actions:  write  -> GET /repos/{org}/classroom50/actions/permissions is
                        reachable only with the Actions permission; a
                        fine-grained PAT's Actions permission is a single
                        read/write pair, so reachability establishes the grant
                        regrade's rerun API needs. No run is re-run.

Scope -> probe (mirrors the wiki REST table):
  Organization Members: R   -> GET /orgs/{org}/members      (+ per-team read)
  Repository Contents: R    -> GET /repos/{org}/classroom50 (config repo)
  Repository Contents: W    -> permissions.push on the config repo
  Repository Administration: W -> permissions.admin on the config repo
  Repository Actions:  R/W  -> GET /repos/{org}/classroom50/actions/permissions
  Repository Metadata: R    -> GET /repos/{org}/classroom50/collaborators

Config + org scopes are ALWAYS probed. Per-classroom, the probe also reads the
classroom team's members (the exact call collect-scores makes), which exercises
team VISIBILITY — a secret team the token can't see 404/403s here even when the
org-members proxy passes. It additionally reads each STAFF team (classroom.json
`teams`, e.g., `classroom50-<short>-ta`) the collect-time grant targets, so a
secret/invisible staff team fails RED here rather than silently granting TAs no
access at collect time. A team that doesn't exist yet (404) is a PASS with a note (an
early-term classroom legitimately has no team), never a failure.

Environment (set by `probe-token.yaml`):
  CLASSROOM50_SERVICE_TOKEN — the fine-grained PAT to probe.
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER   — org name (auto-set by Actions).
  GITHUB_WORKSPACE          — checkout root (holds the per-classroom dirs).
  GITHUB_API_URL            — API URL on GHES runners.
  GH_API_URL                — explicit override (test servers).

Exit codes:
  0 — every required scope present (a per-classroom team read may be skipped
      with a note when the team doesn't exist yet).
  1 — at least one required scope missing, or the token is invalid/expired.
